    <h3>THE NEXT LEAP IN MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS</h3>

    <p1> The SteelSeries Apex Pro is an outstanding keyboard for gamers but it's quite versatile too. It has a unique setting that lets you change the amount of pre-travel distance needed to input a keystroke, which in turns increases and decreases its actuation force. You can lower it for a more responsive experience in games, or you can raise it up to reduce the number of typos and accidental keystrokes when typing text. This keyboard is very well-built and features dedicated media keys and comes with a nice magnetic wrist rest</p1>
<h3> ABOUT THE COMPANY</h3>
    <p1>SteelSeries was founded in 2001 by Jacob Wolff-Petersen.[2] The company's original name was Soft Trading, and it was changed to SteelSeries in 2007.[3] Soft Trading made the Icemat and SteelPad mouse mats, the latter of which influenced the company's eventual name change. In 2008, SteelSeries acquired Ideazon, a North America-based developer and manufacturer of gaming peripherals.[4][5]

Michael von Essen-Mueller, the company's first CEO, helped the company establish its brand and grow to a global footprint. In 2007, SteelSeries hired Bruce Hawver as CEO.[6] The company saw tremendous growth over the next five years as it expanded its portfolio and channels,[7] developed the SteelSeries Engine platform, and added partnerships across the esports and the gaming ecosystem [8][9][10]

In 2012, SteelSeries received investments of undisclosed amounts from U.S.-based private equity firm Catterton Partners and China-based private equity firm ClearVue Partners.[11]

Their popular products include their Rival and Sensei series of mice, Arctis headsets, and Apex keyboards. They also have made 5XL mousepads (QcK line). SteelSeries often creates collaboration lines, such as the Valve ‘Howl’ Edition Mouse and Mousepad Set, and the Cyberpunk collection.

In April 2020, SteelSeries acquired Nahimic audio software developer, A-Volute.[12]</p1>
